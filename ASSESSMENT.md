# AI Field Developer/ Solutions Engineer Assessment Tasks

**Target Roles:** AI Field Developer / AI Solutions Engineer

**Core Focus Areas:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, MCP Gateways, LLM Gateways, Security Guardrails, & System Integration

## Overview

This assessment consists of 4 practical technical tasks designed to evaluate candidates on building MCP servers, implementing LLM & MCP security proxy gateways, handling stream guardrails, managing model routing resilience, and troubleshooting zero-trust network deployments.

---

## Task 1: Build a Custom MCP Server with Strict Validation & Transport Handling

**Format:** Take-Home / 60-min Live Coding

### Problem Statement

Write a runnable MCP server (in TypeScript or Python) using the official SDK (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` or `mcp`) that exposes two tools:

- `get_customer_record` (Input: `customer_id` string formatted as `CUST-XXXXX`).
- `trigger_refund` (Inputs: `customer_id`, `amount` positive float, `reason` string with minimum length of 10).

### Requirements

- Enforce strict input schema validation (using Zod or Pydantic). Reject invalid formats with standard MCP JSON-RPC error codes.
- Connect via stdio transport. Ensure stdout is strictly reserved for JSON-RPC messages and system/debug logs write exclusively to stderr.

### Evaluation Criteria (What to Score)

- **STDIO Isolation:** Verification that stdout is pure JSON-RPC without accidental `console.log` or `print` statements.
- **Protocol Compliance:** Standard JSON-RPC error mapping and execution flow.
- **Validation:** Robust schema definitions and edge-case handling for malformed input fields.

## Task 2: Implement an MCP Security Gateway Proxy (Tool Filtering & Auth)

**Format:** Take-Home Coding Challenge

### Problem Statement

Build a lightweight HTTP/JSON-RPC reverse proxy (in Node.js or Python) that acts as an MCP Gateway sitting between an AI agent client and a downstream mock MCP server.

### Requirements

- Read an incoming `Bearer <token>` HTTP header and extract the user's role (e.g., `admin` or `viewer`).
- Inspect the incoming MCP JSON-RPC payload:
  - If `method` is `tools/list`, forward the request transparently to the downstream server.
  - If `method` is `tools/call`, inspect `params.name`. If `params.name` starts with `admin_` (e.g., `admin_reset_key`), verify that the token role is `admin`. If not authorized, intercept and return a JSON-RPC Error (`-32001: Unauthorized Tool Call`) directly without calling the downstream server.

### Evaluation Criteria (What to Score)

- Parsing JSON-RPC wire format structures correctly.
- Proxy middleware construction and HTTP request/response forwarding.
- Fine-grained, method-level authorization logic and clean error handling.

## Task 3: Implement an LLM Gateway Streaming Guardrail (PII Redaction)

**Format:** Coding Assessment

### Problem Statement

Implement an LLM Gateway proxy endpoint that routes text generation requests to an LLM provider and streams the response back to the client.

### Requirements

- Intercept the returning response chunk stream in real time.
- Parse incoming stream deltas to detect and redact sensitive patterns (such as Emails, SSNs, or credit card numbers), replacing them with `[REDACTED]`.
- Ensure the stream stays responsive without accumulating the full response in memory, minimizing Time To First Token (TTFT) and overall stream latency.

### Evaluation Criteria (What to Score)

- Efficient asynchronous stream chunking and buffer state management.
- Performant string/regex pattern matching over partial text streams.
- Memory efficiency and low-latency proxying design.

## Task 4: Build a Rate-Limiting & Model Fallback Router for LLM Gateways

**Format:** Architectural Coding Task

### Problem Statement

Write a resilient model-routing module for an LLM Gateway that accepts incoming completion requests.

### Requirements

- Implement a token-aware sliding window rate limiter (e.g., maximum 50,000 tokens/minute per tenant API key).
- If the primary model endpoint returns a `429 Too Many Requests` status or times out after 3000ms, automatically failover to a secondary backup model provider.
- Ensure error responses return a standardized gateway error payload without leaking raw upstream stack traces or internal implementation details.
- Use on disk sqlite for database

### Evaluation Criteria (What to Score)

- Async concurrency handling and timeout race conditions.
- Accurate rate-limiter state eviction and token tracking logic.
- Graceful fallback mechanics and standardized error sanitization.
